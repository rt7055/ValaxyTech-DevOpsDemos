https://perrohunter.com/how-to-shutdown-a-kops-kubernetes-cluster-on-aws/

#get the Nodes using below commnands
	
kops edit ig nodes

and set maxSize and minSize to 0

#master, I had to figure my master by doing

kops edit ig master-us-west-2a

and again set maxSize and minSize to 0

#update the Cluster 

kops update cluster --yes
kops rolling-update cluster

If you wanted to turn your cluster back on, rever the settings, changing your master to at least 1, and your nodes to your liking, I use 2.
